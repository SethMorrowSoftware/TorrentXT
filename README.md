# TorrentXT

**The full BitTorrent protocol for OpenXTalk and the xTalk family** (also LiveCode
9.6.3+). Add, control, seed, and inspect torrents — DHT, PEX, magnets and metadata,
uTP, encryption, HTTP+UDP trackers, webseeds, BitTorrent v1 + v2 — all from plain
xTalk script.

TorrentXT is a binding to [**libtorrent-rasterbar**](https://www.libtorrent.org/)
(the battle-tested C++ engine behind many real clients), wrapped behind a small,
stable C ABI and exposed as an OpenXTalk extension. The gigabytes stay on
libtorrent's own network and disk threads; your script only issues tiny commands
and polls small status records — so it stays responsive on a single-threaded
runtime.

```
  your xTalk app
     |   bt* handlers  (btAddMagnet, btTorrentStatus, btPoll, ...)
  library org.openxtalk.library.torrent     src/torrent.lcb
     |   c:torrentxt> btx_*  (a flat extern "C" ABI)
  torrentxt.{so,dll,dylib}                   src/torrent_shim.cpp
     |
  libtorrent-rasterbar + Boost.Asio          owns the network + disk-I/O threads
```

## Features

- **Add anything** — magnet links, `.torrent` files, and resume data; metadata is
  fetched over the swarm for magnets.
- **Full control** — pause, resume, force-recheck, force-reannounce, remove (with or
  without deleting data).
- **Seeding & creation** — build a `.torrent` from a file or folder and seed it.
- **Tuning** — per-file and per-piece priorities, per-torrent and session-wide rate
  limits, and the full libtorrent `settings_pack` surface.
- **Networking** — DHT (BEP 5) with bootstrap and saved state, Local Service
  Discovery, PEX, uTP, UPnP/NAT-PMP, and MSE/PE connection encryption.
- **DHT key-value store (BEP44)** — put/get small signed (mutable) or
  content-addressed (immutable) values: a server-less rendezvous / identity layer.
- **Inspection** — live status snapshots (state, progress, rates, peers, ETA), the
  peer list, and the piece-completion bitfield.
- **Persistence** — save and reload fast-resume data so a partial download survives
  a restart.
- **Events, not callbacks** — inbound activity (metadata received, piece finished,
  torrent finished, tracker replies, errors) arrives as ordinary message-path
  handlers via a poll-drained queue, never from a foreign thread.

## Platform support

The native engine ships **bundled inside the extension** — no `sudo`, no loose
library, no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Installing the packaged extension is all that is
required.

| Platform | Arch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | x86-64 | ✅ committed (statically linked; self-contained on glibc 2.35+ / OpenSSL 3) |
| Linux | x86 (32-bit) | ✅ committed |
| Windows | x86-64 | ✅ committed |
| Windows | x86 (32-bit) | ✅ committed |
| macOS | universal (arm64 + x86-64) | 🚧 buildable from source; signed universal dylib pending |

## Install

In the OpenXTalk IDE, install the packaged extension the same way as any other.
Your stack then sees `library org.openxtalk.library.torrent` and its public `bt*`
handlers on the message path. The engine resolves the `c:torrentxt>` binding
automatically via `the revLibraryMapping`.

Then put the **poll dispatcher** on the message path so you can drive the engine
with event handlers instead of a hand-rolled loop:

```livecodescript
start using stack "torrentHelpers"   -- examples/torrent-helpers.livecodescript
```

It supplies `btStartPolling` / `btStopPolling` and the formatting sugar
(`btFormatBytes`, `btStateName`).

## Quick start

libtorrent owns background threads and OXT has no deterministic extension-unload
hook, so you **bracket the session around your stack's life** — start it in
`openStack`, tear it down in `closeStack`. This is the one rule you must follow.

```livecodescript
local sSession

on openStack
   -- btStartSession verifies the native ABI (throws on skew) and refuses a 2nd
   -- session. It is a command -> read the handle from the result.
   btStartSession
   put the result into sSession
   if sSession is 0 then
      answer "TorrentXT failed to start:" && btLastError()
      exit openStack
   end if
   btSetBool sSession, "enable_dht", true
   -- drive events to this card; a 250 ms drain is plenty for a UI
   btStartPolling sSession, the long id of this card, 250
end openStack

on closeStack
   -- MUST shut down explicitly: pauses, flushes resume data, joins threads.
   btStopPolling
   if sSession is not empty and sSession is not 0 then
      btStopSession sSession
   end if
   put empty into sSession
end closeStack

-- add a magnet and start downloading into a folder
on addOne pMagnet
   btAddMagnet sSession, pMagnet, specialFolderPath("documents") & "/downloads"
   put the result into tTorrent      -- a torrent handle, or 0 on failure
end addOne

-- inbound activity arrives as ordinary handlers (from the poll dispatcher)
on pieceFinished pTorrent, pPieceIndex
   -- update a progress bar, etc.
end pieceFinished

on torrentFinished pTorrent
   local tStatus
   put btTorrentStatus(pTorrent) into tStatus
   answer "Done:" && tStatus["name"]
end torrentFinished
```

`btTorrentStatus(handle)` returns an array (`name`, `state`, `progress`,
`downloadRate`, `uploadRate`, `numPeers`, `eta`, `totalDone`, `totalSize`, …) — poll
it a few times a second to drive a dashboard. See **[getting-started](docs/getting-started.md)**
for the full walkthrough.

## The three rules that make it safe

These are load-bearing and enforced in the code:

1. **No script ever runs on a libtorrent thread.** Every inbound event rides
   libtorrent's alert queue, which the binding poll-drains (`btPoll`). The poll
   interval is a latency/CPU knob, not a correctness knob.
2. **The exception firewall.** libtorrent throws; every `btx_*` entry point wraps
   its body in `try { … } catch (...)` and returns an error code, so no exception
   ever crosses into the engine.
3. **Payload never crosses into script.** Piece data moves engine ⇄ disk on
   libtorrent's threads; script only sees small status records and events.

## Examples

- **[`examples/torrent-client.livecodescript`](examples/torrent-client.livecodescript)**
  — the flagship: a self-building, multi-torrent client with a smart Add box
  (magnet / `.torrent` / HTTP / info-hash), per-torrent controls, create-and-seed, a
  live color-coded table with inline progress bars, DHT bootstrap, and an event log.
- **[`examples/torrent-demo.livecodescript`](examples/torrent-demo.livecodescript)**
  — the minimal add-a-magnet-and-watch-it-finish skeleton the getting-started guide
  walks through.
- **[`examples/torrent-helpers.livecodescript`](examples/torrent-helpers.livecodescript)**
  — the poll dispatcher (`btStartPolling` / `btStopPolling`) and formatting sugar.

  handler, every status/event field, settings keys, return codes.
- **[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** — how the stack fits together, the FFI

- **[TorrentXT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](docs/TorrentXT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)** — the
  original design brief, kept for the *why* (engine choice, ABI design, risk
  register).

## Building from source

You only need this to rebuild the native engine (e.g. for macOS) — most users just
install the packaged extension.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTORRENTXT_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

CMake fetches and statically links the pinned libtorrent (v2.0.11) + Boost. The
build is the heavy part — see **[building.md](docs/building.md)** for details,
sanitizer builds, and the per-platform notes.

## Status

The shim, the LCB binding, the test suite, and four of five platform binaries are
built and gated by CI. Because OpenXTalk has no headless way to compile or run
`.lcb`, runtime behaviour is marked "verified statically; needs an OXT pass" and
confirmed by a human in the IDE — the project does not claim runtime behaviour it
cannot observe. Remaining: the signed macOS universal dylib, and the optional visual
dashboard widget.

## License

TorrentXT (the shim and the LCB binding) is MIT-licensed, in line with the sibling
OpenXTalk extensions. It links **libtorrent-rasterbar** and **Boost**, which are
distributed under the BSD-3-Clause and Boost Software licenses respectively. Those
permissive licenses are why libtorrent was chosen (see the implementation plan §1).
